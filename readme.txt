OBJECTIVE:

This project demonstrates Zipf's law with respect to a particular file input or a certain input from the user.
Zipf's law states that the word with the largest frequency will occur very first in a rank-frequency table.The 
second most used word will appear half as often as the most used word,the third most used word will occur one
thrice as often as the most used word and so on. Zipf's law as observed follows the 20-80 principle where 20
percent of the words form about 80 percent of the total words used in a particular file.

REQUIREMENTS:

                             The program enclosed has been developed and tested on TurboC compiler and so it is recommended to use TurboC.
                             
                              
 
                             The following header files should be present in the IDE/compiler header file library:
                             graphics.h
			     dir.h
                             stdio.h
                             conio.h
                             process.h
                             dos.h
                             ctype.h

HOW TO RUN:

STEP 1: Import the contents of the file sourcecode.txt in your IDE/compiler.
STEP 2: Compile and click run.The output window would pop up displaying four options.
STEP 3: Select the desired option marked as 1,2,3,4.
               The very first option is to read input from a previously created file existing on the system.
               The second  option is to create a file if  you don't want input from a previously created file.Terminate the text with  #  to save the file.
               The third option prints the frequency table from the file read.
               Fourth option exits the program.
